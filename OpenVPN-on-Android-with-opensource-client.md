**Step 2 - Import PrivateVPN OpenVPN client configuration files**

In OpenVPN for Android App, click on the import icon from top-right and navigate to the folder where you extracted *PrivateVPN-TUN-router.zip* file earlier in Step 1. 

Select a .ovpn file you like from UDP folder inside the extracted PrivateVPN-TUN-router folder to import it. You can import as many configuration files as you desire.

For the purpose of this guide, I have used PrivateVPN's OpenVPN configuration file for Switzerland.
